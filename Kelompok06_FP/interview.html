                <h1>Problems Last Season: Josep "Pep" Guardiola Too Hard Heads</h1>

                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p>City's stability begins when they are held to a 3-3 draw by Glasgow Celtic in a Champions League group stage match 2016/2017. At that time Vincent Kompany et al seen the hassles of facing Celtic backlash. Then the difficulty of City was noticed Tottenham who use counter-pressing strategy in the game in the Premier League. Sure enough, in the game that City prioritize control of the ball just pressed by high pressing done Tottenham. </p>
                <p>Especially at that time City play without Kevin de Bruyne who always become attacking midfielder attack. City also added trouble again when Tottenham launched a rapid counterattack and troublesome both wing defenders in the 4-2-3-1 formation. The way Tottenham beat City's possession was imitated by other teams. And Pep still rely on the philosophy of possession of the ball in the next matches. </p>
                <p>Two further matches were held City and Everton and Southampton draw. Then a defeat or a draw against other teams is not free from the difficulty of facing the team with a strong defense and launched a counterattack through a direct long pass. Not to mention coupled with some blunders made by the defender or his goalkeeper. This matter, Claudio Bravo and John Stones are most often blamed. </p>

                <h1>Fixing and Rejuvenating the Back Line</h1>	

                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p>Pep ball possession tactics with City itself is not entirely to blame. However, Pep keeps City's chances in the top four of the standings despite failing the champion is a stain for him. Pep was aware that the back line is a problem during last season although City is the fourth squad at least conceded in the Premier League season 2016/2017. However, no matter how small the problem, it must be repaired and the City experienced in the back line. </p>
                <p>Pep also hinted at making improvements and rejuvenation in the sector in the transfer market this summer. The first position to be addressed is the goalkeeper because of the blunder-blunder Bravo has ever done. Even Squawka noted that he became the worst player in the City game. Then Ederson Moraes was imported from Benfica for 35 million pounds which made him the most expensive goalkeeper in the world. </p>

                <p>Pep brings Ederson because it is expected to provide a good feed so that it can participate in the attack City from behind. Ederson also has the courage to go forward to cut off the opponent's attack like a sweeper-keeper role. While rejuvenation in the back line looks when Pep released three full-back aged over 30 years, namely Aleksandar Kolarov (AS Roma), Bacary Sagna (without club), Gael Clichy (Basaksehir) and Pablo Zabaleta (West Ham United). </p>
                <p>The departure of the full-back was replaced with the arrival of Benjamin Mendy (AS Monaco), Danilo (Real Madrid) and Kyle Walker (Tottenham Hotspur). While City's sharpness during last season only added the purchase of Bernardo Silva from Monaco. Unlike the front-line City who did not bring in a new attacker because they still believe in the ability of Gabriel Jesus, Sergio Aguero and Wilfried Bony. </p>

                <h1>Prediction</h1>

                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p>City transfer efforts in major revamping in the rear sector is able to correct errors last season. The proof, City conceded only three times from four matches and managed nirbobol in the last two pre-season action. Two goals that nestled in goal City against Manchester United also occurred when City did not lower the main central defender. At that time Pep played Tosin Adarabioyo who was a promotional player from the City academy on the formation of four defenders. </p>
                <p>City conceded when Adarabioyo was still playing for one full half. Then since he replaced Nicolas Otamendi at the turn of the round, City's defense no longer conceded until the game ended. Then Pep began to replace the formation with three defenders by playing his flagship defender so only conceded once in the next three games. </p>
                <p>The City's improved defense record is also supported by Pep's game philosophy that is beginning to change. Pep began to reduce ball control for too long. Kompany et al also more often launched fast pass-operands directed to the front. Unlike the previous previous season by spinning the ball to win control of the opponent. </p>
                <p>As a result, tough opponents are able to be defeated during pre-season. After defeated MU, changes in formation and pattern of City's attack able to bulldoze Madrid, Tottenham and West Ham with a margin of three goals. Transfer, change tactics and game City can be back believed to be his supporters to get into the candidate for English Premier League champions 2017/2018. </p>
