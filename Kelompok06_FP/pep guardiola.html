                <p>Guardiola, who joined in the summer of 2016, has just overseen the best season in the Club’s history, winning the Premier League title in record-breaking fashion, in addition to the League Cup secured in March after a 3-0 victory over Arsenal at Wembley. </p>
                <p>We became the first side in English football to achieve 100 points in a top-flight campaign – and we also posted the most goals and wins in Premier League history, ensuring our place in the pantheon of great Premier League sides is secure. </p>
                <p>His deal means this is the longest commitment he has made a football Club since becoming a manager in 2008. </p>
                <p>“I am so happy and excited. It’s a pleasure to be able to work here,” Guardiola said. </p>
                <p>“I enjoy working with our players every day and we will try to do our best together in the coming years. As a manager, you have to feel good to be with the players – and I feel good. </p>
                <p>“I will focus on the desire of my players to become a better team and every day that’s what I will try to do – to improve on the pitch and improve our players. We have a young squad with an average age of 23 and we want to keep taking steps forward and maintain the levels we’ve achieved this season.” </p>
                <p>Manchester City FC Chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, said: “We are delighted to announce the extension of Pep’s contract through to 2021. In his two seasons with us, he has fostered an incredible spirit within the squad and significantly contributed to our progress both on and off the field. In doing so he has embodied the passion and commitment we all have for the Club. </p>
                <p>“I am very much looking forward to the continued impact of his work and to fulfilling our shared ambitions in the coming seasons.” </p>
                <p>And Chief Executive Officer, Ferran Soriano, added: “Pep’s new contract extension is fantastic news for Manchester City. We have all been privileged to witness how we have played beautiful football, won titles, broken records and reached the incredible mark of 100 Premier League points. Pep has shown this style can succeed in the Premier League in a way it has never been done before. </p>
                <p>“This season has been another step of our strategic plan and the continuous effort to improve the football we play. We are very pleased with the progress. There is more work to do and having Pep committed to Manchester City for the next three seasons gives us the stability to be able to continue our journey to beautiful football and success for the Club.” </p>
                <p>Guardiola has won 77 of his 113 games in charge at City – a win ratio of more than 68% - and the 32 league wins he managed this season are the most he has achieved in a single campaign, beating the 31 with Barcelona in 2009/10. </p>
                <p>He has now won 23 major trophies in nine seasons as a manager. </p>
                <p>Everyone at City is delighted with the news and we all wish Pep well over the remainder of his time here. </p>
