                <p>Manchester City are finally close to completing a deal for Leicester winger Riyad Mahrez, reports The Sun. </p>
                <p>The champions tried to sign Mahrez in the final week of the January transfer window, but Leicester refused to enter negotiations, leading to the 27-year-old handing in a transfer request. </p>
                <p>Mahrez has since withdrawn that request, but it's believed he has an understanding with the Foxes allowing him to leave if one of Europe's elite clubs makes a reasonable offer. </p>
                <p>And it seems City are set to take advantage of that arrangement, pushing through a £65 million move for the Algeria international at the start of the transfer window. </p>
                <p>That could spell the end of Pep Guardiola's interest in Wilfried Zaha, with the Daily Express reporting that the winger intends to stay Crystal Palace anyway. </p>

                <p>The goal was scrappy, the finish applied from a few yards in a crowded penalty area. The immediate significance was that it put Manchester City 3-1 ahead at Tottenham. It assumed a greater importance the following day when Manchester United's shock defeat to West Bromwich Albion made City champions. </p>
                <p>But even before then, a different meaning was apparent. It was Raheem Sterling's 22nd goal of the season. He had doubled his previous best tally. It used to be a mantra of Manuel Pellegrini's that the winger should score goals. It is an achievement of Pep Guardiola that he has converted Sterling's potential into potency. </p>
                <p>But he has company. Around an hour earlier, Ilkay Gundogan converted a penalty. His sixth goal of the season was a new personal best. Another German, Leroy Sane, had already rattled the post. His total stayed at 13, still a career high. Injury deprived Sergio Aguero of the chance to participate; otherwise he may have closed in on his biggest haul of 33 which, nevertheless, came under Guardiola's management. </p>

                <p>For a manager like Pep Guardiola who believes that players remaining calm is crucial to success, Leroy Sane looks like his perfect attacker. Sane is so relaxed he is able to fall asleep on the team bus in the five minutes it takes it to travel from Manchester City's academy to the Etihad on matchday. </p>
                <p>That ability to stay calm and clear-headed in the final third of the pitch as seen him contribute 12 assists in the Premier League this season -- only behind teammate Kevin De Bruyne in England and the top five leagues in Europe -- as well as scoring nine goals. And his remarkable individual performance was rewarded with the Young Player of the Year accolade at Sunday's PFA Awards night. </p> 
                <p>To put his form into context, one more goal in City's remaining four fixtures would seem him register double figures for both goals and assists -- something that no other player in the Premier League has done this season or the last. In England, Spain, Germany and Italy so far this season, only Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Lazio's Luis Alberto have achieved the feat. </p>

                <p>There was something fitting about Manchester City leaving it until the last kick of the season to secure 100 Premier League points, becoming the first club ever to make that landmark in the top flight. </p>
                <p>Gabriel Jesus' strike right on the stroke of full-time in his side's 1-0 success at Southampton came almost exactly six years to the minute that Sergio Aguero netted in the 3-2 victory over QPR to win the club's first Sheikh Mansour era title in 2012. Add that to Paul Dickov's equaliser in the 2-2 draw with Gillingham in the infamous Division Two playoff final in 1999 and it seems like City only ever make their landmark moments with seconds to spare. </p>
                <p>Whatever had happened on the south coast on Sunday afternoon, City would have been remembered as the greatest Premier League team over the course of a year. That was always going to be the case because of the runs they've been on, the performances they've put in both home and away, and the sheer domination over the rest of the English top flight. </p>
                <p>But, as Pep Guardiola has had a habit of saying recently, records are there to be broken. It will take a truly phenomenal campaign to better what City have achieved this term, but someday it will be done -- even if it takes decades. When that happens, had Sunday's match ended in a draw or defeat for the champions, they'd have faded away as just another team with an extraordinary campaign. </p>
